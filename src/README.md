# Space Geeks Frontend
<img src="./Space Geek.gif">

I am trying to develop a web application using API services related to Space. This website will have multiple features like an interactive Solar System Model, Image Gallery, Space Events Calendar, News, etc. This repository contains the front-end code only. You can view the frontend code output [here](https://ishan2608.github.io/SpaceGeek/).

I will be developing the backend in Python programming language, using its Flask framework. Some API calls will be made directly by the front end, and some will be made by the back end. The link to the backend source code will be provided soon. Currently, the "Read More", "save" and "Open" buttons do not work in the APO, events and news sections respectively.

If you have an idea that can improve the site, whether it is a feature or the overall UI, do let me know. I am open to making this project be able to do... MORE.

NOTE: The website is not 100% responsive. I am having some trouble with the events calendar. It would be great to receive your help.
